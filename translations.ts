However, different models have varying adherence to instructions. I spent a lot of time testing prompt quality from different models. Now even free models produce decent quality, but there are still occasional inaccuracies (e.g., overhead shots recognized as eye-level). When using, it's recommended to review AI results and correct inaccuracies. This is also an important skill in collaborating with AI: the ability to review and correct AI outputs."

My intention is just to share a small tool I developed, to verify whether I can make something valuable to others starting from my own needs.",
        q2: "Analysis failed or error. What's the cause? How to fix?",
        a2: "Check network connection, whether API Key is correctly filled, API Key validity, AI provider regional restrictions.\n• If it's a VPN issue, try switching VPN nodes. VPN nodes need to be clean and in the AI provider's accessible region.\n• If API key hit free usage limit, switch to a free AI model provider (SiliconFlow), or subscribe to paid API for advanced models.\n• Check if API key is entered incorrectly or mismatched with provider, such as extra spaces, or Google API entered under OpenAI.",
        q3: "How to switch language?",
        a3: "The purple panel on home page allows quick switching of interface language. For prompt card front/back languages, go to Settings page (supports Chinese/English/Japanese and 7 languages total).",
        q4: "Multiple dimension prompts failed to parse, showing 'N/A'?",
        a4: "Sometimes the model is lazy and doesn't return all field information. Just click the refresh button above the card that's missing prompts.",
        q5: "Will version updates cause previously queried data to disappear?",
        a5: "No, version updates won't clear your queried images and prompts, but system upgrades on your own device will. Please carefully read point 2 of Must Read Before Use regarding data storage and security.",
        q6: "What does Style Preference in settings do?",
        a6: "This is an entry I reserved for ideas not yet implemented. Currently, selecting different style preferences only affects the terminology preference of output prompts, but this module hasn't been extensively tested yet. Just select the default Standard style for now.",
        q7: "How to use preset tags in chat mode?",
        a7: "Click ➕ to customize your frequently used preset tags (such as useful image reverse-engineering instructions, prompts for extracting specific dimensions, etc.). All tags can be edited (right-click), deleted (long-press to activate delete state), and reordered (drag tags to your desired position, put frequently used ones at the front).

        a1: "工具本身是免费的，但如果要使用付费的api服务，用户得自己支付api的费用，这个费用是直接付给模型厂商的，我无法从中获得收益（所以我特意接入了免费的api，让您可以在完全免费的模式下使用）。我的本意只是分享一个自己开发的小工具，验证我是否能从自己的需求出发做出对别人也有价值的产品，看自己能vibe coding到什么程度。",
        q2: "分析失败或报错是什么原因？如何解决？",
        a2: "检查网络连接、API Key 填写是否正确、API Key 有效性、AI 提供商区域限制。\\n• 如果是VPN问题，请更换VPN节点后重试。VPN节点需要干净且在AI 提供商的可访问区域。\\n• 如果是api key触达免费使用限额，可以更换成免费的ai模型提供商（siliconflow），或者开通高级模型的付费api。\\n• 检查api key是否填写错误或是否对应错模型提供商，比如多了空格，或把google的api填写到了openai的下方。",
        q3: "如何切换语言？",
        a3: "首页紫色面板可快速切换界面语言，提示词卡片正反面语言请到设置页面选择（支持中/英/日等7种语言）。",
        q4: "多个维度提示词解析失败，出现'N/A'？",
        a4: "有时模型偷懒未返回所有字段信息就会出现这种情况，点击未出现提示词的卡片上方的刷新按钮就可以了。",
        q5: "版本更新会导致之前查询过的数据消失吗？",
        a5: "不会，更新版本不会清除你查询过的图片和提示词，但您自己设备上的系统升级会。关于数据的存储和安全问题请仔细阅读使用前必读第二点。",
        q6: "设置页的风格偏好有什么用？",
        a6: "这是我为还没实现的想法预留的入口，目前选择不同风格偏好只会影响输出提示词的术语偏好，但这个模块的表现还没经过大量测试，目前直接选默认的标准风格就可以。",
        q7: "对话模式下的预设标签如何使用？",
        a7: "点击➕号可以个性化定制自己常用的预设标签（比如好用的反推图片指令、提取特定维度的提示词等），所有标签都可以编辑（鼠标右键）、删除（长按标签会激活删除状态）、排序（按住标签拖拽到你想要的位置，把常用标签拖放到前面）。设置好标签后，点击标签就会发送出对应的问题或指令，得到AI基于当前这张图片的回答。"

However, different models have varying adherence to instructions. I spent a lot of time testing prompt quality from different models. Now even free models produce decent quality, but there are still occasional inaccuracies (e.g., overhead shots recognized as eye-level). When using, it's recommended to review AI results and correct inaccuracies. This is also an important skill in collaborating with AI: the ability to review and correct AI outputs."

My intention is just to share a small tool I developed, to verify whether I can make something valuable to others starting from my own needs.",
        q2: "Analysis failed or error. What's the cause? How to fix?",
        a2: "Check network connection, whether API Key is correctly filled, API Key validity, AI provider regional restrictions.\\n• If it's a VPN issue, try switching VPN nodes. VPN nodes need to be clean and in the AI provider's accessible region.\\n• If API key hit free usage limit, switch to a free AI model provider (SiliconFlow), or subscribe to paid API for advanced models.\\n• Check if API key is entered incorrectly or mismatched with provider, such as extra spaces, or Google API entered under OpenAI.",
        q3: "How to switch language?",
        a3: "The purple panel on home page allows quick switching of interface language. For prompt card front/back languages, go to Settings page (supports Chinese/English/Japanese and 7 languages total).",
        q4: "Multiple dimension prompts failed to parse, showing 'N/A'?",
        a4: "Sometimes the model is lazy and doesn't return all field information. Just click the refresh button above the card that's missing prompts.",
        q5: "Will version updates cause previously queried data to disappear?",
        a5: "No, version updates won't clear your queried images and prompts, but system upgrades on your own device will. Please carefully read point 2 of Must Read Before Use regarding data storage and security.",
        q6: "What does Style Preference in settings do?",
        a6: "This is an entry I reserved for ideas not yet implemented. Currently, selecting different style preferences only affects the terminology preference of output prompts, but this module hasn't been extensively tested yet. Just select the default Standard style for now.",
        q7: "How to use preset tags in chat mode?",
        a7: "Click ➕ to customize your frequently used preset tags (such as useful image reverse-engineering instructions, prompts for extracting specific dimensions, etc.). All tags can be edited (right-click), deleted (long-press to activate delete state), and reordered (drag tags to your desired position, put frequently used ones at the front).

However, different models have varying adherence to instructions. I spent a lot of time testing prompt quality from different models. Now even free models produce decent quality, but there are still occasional inaccuracies (e.g., overhead shots recognized as eye-level).

My intention is just to share a small tool I developed, to verify whether I can make something valuable to others starting from my own needs.",
        q2: "Analysis failed or error. What's the cause? How to fix?",
        a2: "Check network connection, whether API Key is correctly filled, API Key validity, AI provider regional restrictions.\\n• If it's a VPN issue, try switching VPN nodes. VPN nodes need to be clean and in the AI provider's accessible region.\\n• If API key hit free usage limit, switch to a free AI model provider (SiliconFlow), or subscribe to paid API for advanced models.\\n• Check if API key is entered incorrectly or mismatched with provider, such as extra spaces, or Google API entered under OpenAI.",
        q3: "How to switch language?",
        a3: "The purple panel on home page allows quick switching of interface language. For prompt card front/back languages, go to Settings page (supports Chinese/English/Japanese and 7 languages total).",
        q4: "Multiple dimension prompts failed to parse, showing 'N/A'?",

        q6: "What does Style Preference in settings do?",

        a7: "Click ➕ to customize your frequently used preset tags (such as useful image reverse-engineering instructions, prompts for extracting specific dimensions, etc.). All tags can be edited (right-click), deleted (long-press to activate delete state), and reordered (drag tags to your desired position, put frequently used ones at the front).

        a7: "Click ➕ to customize your frequently used preset tags (such as useful image reverse-engineering instructions, prompts for extracting specific dimensions, etc.). All tags can be edited (right-click), deleted (long-press to activate delete state), and reordered (drag tags to your desired position, put frequently used ones at the front). After setting up tags, clicking a tag will send the corresponding question or instruction and get AI's answer based on the current image."

However, different models have varying adherence to instructions. I spent a lot of time testing prompt quality from different models. Now even free models produce decent quality, but there are still occasional inaccuracies (e.g., overhead shots recognized as eye-level). When using, it's recommended to review AI results and correct inaccuracies. This is also an important skill in collaborating with AI: the ability to review and correct AI outputs."

My intention is just to share a small tool I developed, to verify whether I can make something valuable to others starting from my own needs.",
        q2: "Analysis failed or error. What's the cause? How to fix?",
        a2: "Check network connection, whether API Key is correctly filled, API Key validity, AI provider regional restrictions.\\n• If it's a VPN issue, try switching VPN nodes. VPN nodes need to be clean and in the AI provider's accessible region.\\n• If API key hit free usage limit, switch to a free AI model provider (SiliconFlow), or subscribe to paid API for advanced models.\\n• Check if API key is entered incorrectly or mismatched with provider, such as extra spaces, or Google API entered under OpenAI.",
        q3: "How to switch language?",
        a3: "The purple panel on home page allows quick switching of interface language. For prompt card front/back languages, go to Settings page (supports Chinese/English/Japanese and 7 languages total).",
        q4: "Multiple dimension prompts failed to parse, showing 'N/A'?",
        a4: "Sometimes the model is lazy and doesn't return all field information. Just click the refresh button above the card that's missing prompts.",
        q5: "Will version updates cause previously queried data to disappear?",
        a5: "No, version updates won't clear your queried images and prompts, but system upgrades on your own device will. Please carefully read point 2 of Must Read Before Use regarding data storage and security.",

However, different models have varying adherence to instructions. I spent a lot of time testing prompt quality from different models. Now even free models produce decent quality, but there are still occasional inaccuracies (e.g., overhead shots recognized as eye-level). When using, it's recommended to review AI results and correct inaccuracies. This is also an important skill in collaborating with AI: the ability to review and correct AI outputs."

        q1: "Is Snaplex free? Where might I need to pay?",
        a1: "The tool itself is free, but if you use paid API services, you pay the API fees directly to the model providers—I cannot profit from this (so I specifically integrated free APIs so you can use it completely free). My intention is just to share a small tool I developed, to verify whether I can make something valuable to others starting from my own needs.",
        q2: "Analysis failed or error. What's the cause? How to fix?",
        a2: "Check network connection, whether API Key is correctly filled, API Key validity, AI provider regional restrictions.\\n• If it's a VPN issue, try switching VPN nodes. VPN nodes need to be clean and in the AI provider's accessible region.\\n• If API key hit free usage limit, switch to a free AI model provider (SiliconFlow), or subscribe to paid API for advanced models.\\n• Check if API key is entered incorrectly or mismatched with provider, such as extra spaces, or Google API entered under OpenAI.",
        q3: "How to switch language?",
        a3: "The purple panel on home page allows quick switching of interface language. For prompt card front/back languages, go to Settings page (supports Chinese/English/Japanese and 7 languages total).",
        q4: "Multiple dimension prompts failed to parse, showing 'N/A'?",
        a4: "Sometimes the model is lazy and doesn't return all field information. Just click the refresh button above the card that's missing prompts.",
        q5: "Will version updates cause previously queried data to disappear?",
        a5: "No, version updates won't clear your queried images and prompts, but system upgrades on your own device will. Please carefully read point 2 of Must Read Before Use regarding data storage and security.",
        q6: "What does Style Preference in settings do?",
        a6: "This is an entry I reserved for ideas not yet implemented. Currently, selecting different style preferences only affects the terminology preference of output prompts, but this module hasn't been extensively tested yet. Just select the default Standard style for now.",
        q7: "How to use preset tags in chat mode?",
        a7: "Click ➕ to customize your frequently used preset tags (such as useful image reverse-engineering instructions, prompts for extracting specific dimensions, etc.). All tags can be edited (right-click), deleted (long-press to activate delete state), and reordered (drag tags to your desired position, put frequently used ones at the front). After setting up tags, clicking a tag will send the corresponding question or instruction and get AI's answer based on the current image."
