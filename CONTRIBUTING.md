## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ginger4soda-netizen/snaplex/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ginger4soda-netizen/snaplex/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the AGPL-3.0 License and that you have signed the CLA granting rights for commercial licensing.
